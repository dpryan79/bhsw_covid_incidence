# Covid-19 incidence per week by community

This repository is meant to compute and display the population-normalized Covid-19 incidence for each community (Gemeinde) in Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald per week. Only limited data is available, since it's [published weekly as a PDF](https://www.breisgau-hochschwarzwald.de/pb/Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald/Start/Service+_+Verwaltung/Corona-Virus.html) and previous week's data removed. GIS data is from [ESRI Deutschland](https://opendata-esri-de.opendata.arcgis.com/) and Â© GeoBasis-DE / BKG 2016.
